## Hello !

My name is Th√©o and I'm a first year student at Epitech's school.  
I'm actually learning C, Python and a bit of Bash through my school curriculum.  

### Epitech's projects

You can check some of the projects I've done this year.  
They are written in C, the language we learn all the first year.    

### Personal projects

I'm currently working on a web application project to synchronize calendars in the same way that Google Angenda can do it.  
I think it's a good practice to develop my skills in languages that I'm not learning yet in my school curriculum.  
You can check my notes on my public repo https://github.com/zoldik333/Epicalendar
Here are some languages or technologies that I am learning and trying to implement:  
&nbsp;- HTML, CSS (with Tailwind) and Reactjs for the front-end  
&nbsp;- Javascript  
&nbsp;- PHP  
&nbsp;- MySQL  
&nbsp;- Rest API.

## Hello !

My name is Th√©o and I'm a third year student at Epitech's school.  
I'm very interested in Devops and I'm currently trying to train myself in various technologies through personal projects alongside my school year.
I also want to improve in fullstack development using web technologies and creating an application that I would like to use later.
You can check some of the projects I've done at school and also my personal ones.

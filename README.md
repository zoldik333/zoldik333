## Hello !

My name is Théo and I'm a first year student at Epitech's school.  
I'm actually learning C, Python and a bit of Bash through my school curriculum.  

### Epitech's projects

You can check some of the projects I've done this year.  
They are written in C, the language we learn all the first year.    

### Personal projects

I'm currently working on a web application project to synchronize calendars in the same way that Google Angenda can do it.  
I think it's a good practice to develop my skills in languages that I'm not learning yet in my school curriculum.  
Here are some languages or technologies I am learning and trying to implement:  
&nbsp;- HTML    
&nbsp;- CSS    
&nbsp;- Javascript    
&nbsp;- PHP  
&nbsp;- MySQL.
